# NPM Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to understand how to use npm (Node Package Manager). Some of these steps might not necessarily be 'gradable' but please do them anyway for your own learning.

## Steps

1. **Create an npm project**
2. **Install the 'moment' package**
3. **Examine the directory structures and effects on package.json**
4. **Delete the node_modules folder and run `npm install` again**
5. **Create an `index.js` file and update `package.json` so that `npm start` will run it**
6. **Import the 'moment' module in your application**
7. **Use 'moment' to output the timestamp for when the response arrives using the format `h:mm:ss a`**
8. **Add `.gitignore` to ignore the node_modules folder**
